# Android-Pentesting

I am using a rooted device if you don't have one use android studio.

1) root your device using magisk to root your android device, you can find here https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk
2) if you are using a rooted device install https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb on your Mac/windows to operate the device using CLI (Command line terminal)
3) connect your device using a wire 
4) now open cli or terminal and go to the same directory 
5) use the command ./adb shell
