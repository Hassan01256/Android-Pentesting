# Android-Pentesting

I am using a rooted device if you don't have one use android studio.
if you are confused about the device being ARM or x86 just use the command adb shell getprop ro.product.cpu.abi

. root your device using magisk to root your android device, you can find here https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk
. if you are using a rooted device install https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb on your Mac/windows to operate the device using CLI (Command line terminal)
. connect your device using a wire 
. now open cli or terminal and go to the same directory 
. use the command ./adb devices

. Now you need to install the CA certificate into your android mobile so, that you can capture the requests using burp suite.
. open your burp > go to proxy > options > import/export CA certificate > certificate in DER format > save the file using the format .der
. send the file to the mobile using the command adb push CA.der /storage/sdcard0/
. open file in your mobile > internal storage and you will see the file CA.der 
. rename the file from CA.der to CA.cer
. now go to settings > security > Encryption and Credentials > Install from SD Card > CA.cer. Choose VPN and Apps in the credentials use and click on OK.

once the certificat has been installed Configure your device to use the proxy
Make sure that your Android device is disconnected from the Wi-Fi network before you attempt to configure the proxy settings:

In your Android device, go to Settings > Network & internet.
Select Internet and long-press the name of your Wi-Fi network.
Select Modify.
From the Advanced options menu, select Proxy > Manual.
Set Proxy hostname to the IP of the computer running Burp Suite Professional.
Set Proxy port to the port value that you configured for the Burp Proxy listener, in this example 8082.
Touch Save.
